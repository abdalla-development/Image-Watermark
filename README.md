    • This project is essential when working on the media to reflect either the copyrights or to let the user knows the author of what he is browsing.
    • The hard part was to implement two different screens, yes it could have been done by only one, but as for my personal approach, I thought it would provide a better experience.
    • The easy part was implementing the layout as you are limited by using the Tkinter library.
    • As an improvement, I would look up another library that will provide more customization over the window layout.
    • The biggest goal I had learned from conducting this project is never to surrender to frustration, as you reach some points in the code that might be impossible to solve at first, but by applying analytical thinking and doing some google search you would grasp an idea of how to tackle this point.
